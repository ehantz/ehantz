- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehantz
- 👀 I’m interested in computer-aided drug design. My background is in computational biophysics, where I have used
  enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to study protein-ligand dynamics. Additionally, I have extensive
  experience in structure-based and ligand-based docking techniques. I also have experience in python and bash programming
  languages and working within HPC environments.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to effectively apply AI methods to drug discovery problems, as well as working with large
  proteomics and genomics data sets in a computational biology context. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML applications.
- 📫 How to reach me, email - eric.hantz@ucsf.edu
